## Steps

1.  Clone the Repo in your local machine
2.  Fetch all updated code from the upstream / remote repo .
3.  Merge locally
4.  Push the code to the forked repo.

## 1. Cloning the Repo

once you have forked the repo, to clone the repo in your local machine use below code

```git file=terminal
git clone <repo_name >
```

This will create a repo folder in the directory path where you have used this command.

Enter into the folder /repo by "cd <repo_name>"

## 2. Add a link to the Remote

Now in your local machine , the repo is indiviual , No connection to the remote .So ,we need to setup a connection with the remote branch , for that we use below command

```git file=terminal
git remote add upstream <repo_name >
```

and we can see the connection by using "git remote -v"

<Accordation heading="Using git remote -v">
git remote -v

git remote < upstream_repo_ulr> (fetch)

git remote < upstream_repo_ulr> (push)

git origin < forked_repo_ulr> (origin)

git origin < forked_repo_ulr> (push)

Note: origin keyword stands for the forked repo

</Accordation >


## 3. Fetch from remote repo

Now we need to fetch the branches and thier respective commits from the upstream

```js file=terminal
git fetch upstream //fetches all the udpates from all branches

git fetch upstream/<branch_name > // only fetches the updates from that branch
```

## 4. Merge the updates

To merge the changes into the respective branches, we need to be in that branch ,to switch to the branches and to merge we use .

```js file=terminal
git checkout <branch_name> //this will make the branch_name as default branch in local

git merge upstream/<branch_name > // will merge the both the code from the branch
```

<Callouts name="info">
  git pull is a combination of both git fetch && git merge
  <p>-> fetches all the code from branch and merges directly</p>{" "}
</Callouts>

All the latest code from the remote repo /< branch > merged with the forked repo / < branch > LOCALLY.

## 5. Push the code to Forked Repo

last step , we need to push the code to our forked repo to make sure updated code is saved in forked repo .

```js file=terminal
git push origin <branch_name>
```

### Key Points

1. To clone a repo -- git clone < repo_name >
2. To switch from one branch to another branch -- git checkout < branch>
3. To add a remote/ upstream repo to get updates -- git remote add upstream < repo_link>
4. To fetch the latest commits from remote -- git fetch upstream
5. To merge the latest code from remote into the fork -- git merge upstream/< branch>
6. To push the code into the repo -- <i>git push origin < branch></i>
7. combination of fetch and merge - git pull < branch>
