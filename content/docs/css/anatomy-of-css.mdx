#### Rule Syntax

```css show=false
selector {
  property-name: property-value;
}
```

Selector is a Html component which you want to apply styles to it. property and its value is separated by colon ( : ) and each property in the declaration block is delimited by ( ; ) semicolon

property-value can be single value or multiple values separated by space .

selectors can be anything like tags( h1 - h6, p, span) or Classes (.mainHeading, .classTwo) or Id (#main, #about) , Universal selector ( \* ) , or even attributes.

```css show=false
h5 {
  color: red;
}
h5 {
  color: blue;
}
```

This is called as <strong>Property Conflict </strong>. Multiple declaration of same property for same selector. Css parser parses and applies the style
which is last defined .In this case , color blue is applied.
