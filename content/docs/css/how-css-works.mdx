Most fundamental concepts of css is Cascading ,Specificity, Inheritance and order of appearance which controls how css is applied
to Html and how conflicts are resolved.

#### How CSS Works

1. Browser loads the Html (recieved from Network).
2. It converts the Html components into the DOM (Document Object Model) which represents Documents in memory.
3. Browser then loads all the resourses that are linked to the HTMl Document such as images, videos, linked CSS and lastly Javascript.
4. Browser parses fetched CSS , these all declarations must go through all level of filtering and validations done by browser. It sorts all the different rules by their selector types.
5. It converts all the CSS rules into the CSSOM (Css Object Model) link DOM .
6. based on selector type and order of appearance , browser finds which styles needs to apply for which HTMl Dom Node.
7. render tree combines both the HTMl DOM and CSSOM together displayed as webpage.
