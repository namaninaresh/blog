A Data Structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence or a linear list.
There are two ways of representing linear data structures in memory. One way is to have the linear relationship between the elements
by means of sequential memory locations. Such linear structures are <strong>Arrays</strong>. The other way is to have the linear relationship
between the elements representing by means of links. such linear data structures are called <strong>Linked List</strong>.

#### Examples:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues

<Callouts name="info ">
  Stacks and Queues are implemented using Arrays and Lists
</Callouts>

#### Arrays Representation

<div class="arrays">
  <ul>
    <li>Value1 </li>
    <li>Value2</li>
  </ul>
</div>
Arrays are Homogenous and Static type (allocations of memory is done at the beginning)

#### Linked List representation

<div class="linked__container">
  <ul>
    <li>Value | NextNode</li>
    <li>Value | NextNode</li>
  </ul>
</div>
NextNode will store address of a next connected node. Linked Lists are HetroGenous
and Dynamic type (allocation of memory is done at run time)

<Callouts name="success ">
  Homogenous (Arrays) : The data structures which contains single type of data
  either Integer or Strings or Other
  <br />
  HetroGenous (Lists) : The Data Structure which contains multiple types of data
  like Interger ,Strings, Floats
</Callouts>
