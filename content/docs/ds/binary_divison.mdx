## Binary Division :

process of diving two binary numbers.

### Rules :

<table class="table-space table-border">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Dividend</th>
      <th></th>
      <th>Divisor</th>
      <th></th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>/</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>=</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>/</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>=</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

  Diving 0 by something gives Error , not mentioned in Rules.

#### Note: Before learnig Binary division, please go through [Binary Substraction](/learn/ds/binary_substraction)

### Steps : 011010 / 0101 =?

<Callouts name="info">29 * 9 =? i.e., 11101 = 29 and 1001 = 9 </Callouts>

1.Remove all the zeros from the most Significant Bit (MSB) or from left to rigt.

Dividend = 11010<sub>2</sub> , Divisor = 101<sub>2</sub>

2.Since Divisor is smaller, it will be multiplied with 1 and result will be the substrahend. while substracting ,follow binary Substraction rules.

```javascript file=index.js show=false diff
//Binary Divison of 11010 / 101
             ➊
      _____________
  101 ) 1  ̷1̷ 0 1 0 ( 1
  -     1  0 1
      -------------
        0  0 1
```

3.As per rules of division, the next lease Significant Bit comes down and divisor is multiplied by 1,
since the result 101 is bigger than the minuend 0011 , this step cannot be performed ,then we have to multiply by 0

```javascript file=index.js show=false diff
//Binary Divison of 11010 / 101
             ➊
      _____________
  101 ) 1  ̷1̷ 0 1 0 ( 1 0
  -     1  0 1
      -------------
        0  0 1 1
             0 0
      -------------
             1 1 0
```

4.write down 0 as next bit of quotient.

5.Again divisor is multiplied by 1 .result is written as 101 \* 1 = 101

6.In final step, as per binary Substraction.we substract 101<sub>2</sub> from 110<sub>2</sub>
,we get 110-101 = 001<sub>2</sub>

```javascript file=index.js show=false diff
//Binary Divison of 11010 / 101
             ➊
      _____________
  101 ) 1  ̷1̷ 0 1 0 ( 1 0 1
  -     1  0 1
      -------------
        0  0 1 1
      -      0 0
      -------------
             1 1 0
      -      1 0 1
      -------------
                 1
```

Now Quotient = ( 101 )<sub>2</sub> , Remainder = 001 = 1.

<Callouts name="success">
  Answer : 101<sub>2</sub> = 5<sub>10</sub> 
  
<br></br>11010<sub>2</sub> = 25<sub>10</sub> / 101<sub>2</sub> = 5<sub>10</sub>

</Callouts>
