A Data Structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer , so that it can be used efficiently. A Data Structure is collection of collection of data elements organized in a specific manner, characterized by its own specific methods of accesing data elements.

<h3>Need of Data Structure</h3>
    As applications are getting complexed and amount of data is increasing day by day. these may arise the following patterns: 

1. <strong>Resources overflow</strong> : To handle very large amount of data , we need to more space to process and more processor speed is required. As data is grouwing day by day to the billions of files per day, the resources (processor) couldnt handle large amount of data .
2. <strong>Time Consuming</strong> : If we need to find a element in a array, it works very fast.But finding a element in a large array which contains billions of elements , it takes lots of time. Results in slowing down the resulting output as excepted.
3. <strong>Concurrent request processing</strong> : If thousands of users are searching the data simultaneously on a web server, then there are changes that a very large server can be failed during that process.

Data Structure can be classified into :
  <ul>
    <li>Primitive type</li>
    <li>Non Primitive type</li>
  </ul>
