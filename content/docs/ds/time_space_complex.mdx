Performance of an Algorithm is measured in Time and Space complexity.

1. Time Complexity : way of representing the amount of time needed by a program to run to the completion.
2. Space Complexity : amount of memory space required by an algorithm during a course of its execution. It is required in situations when limited memory is available and for the multi user system.

<div class="tree-diagram">
    <ul>  
        <li>Time Complexity
            <ul>
                <li>Constant Time O(1)</li>
                <li>Logarithmic time</li>
                <li>Linear Time O(n)</li>
                <li>Quadratic Time O(n2)</li>
                <li>Exponential time</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

1. Best Case : when the minimum amount of input is given
2. Worst Case : when the maximum amount of input is given.

<Callouts name="info ">
  During analyses of algorithm, mostly we will consider worst case scenarios
  only
</Callouts>

<Callouts name="warning ">
  Assigning values to variables or return statement or print statements takes
  constant time 1 unit represented in O(1) , it won't be dependent on length of
  array or any other .
</Callouts>

```js file=index.js highlights=13 show=false
int a = 5;      // 1

for(int i=0;i<n;i++)   //n + 1  (n times loop runs, 1 time checks condition and fails)
  System.out.println(i);  // 1
----------------------------------
Time Complexity :
f(n) = 1 + (n+1) +1
f(n) = n+3
f(n) = n

= O(n)

```

#### Rules of Time Complexity

- \* Find the fastest growing term
- \* Take out the coefficent

2. Drop Constants

```js file=index.js highlights=13 show=false
{
  for() { ... } // O(n)
  for() { ... } // O(n)
}
----------------------------------
Time Complexity :
= O(n) + O(n)
= O( ̶2̶n) //dropping constants,2 is deleted
= O(n)

= O(n)

```

3. Drop non-dominate term / growing term

```js file=index.js highlights=13 show=false

f(n) = O(n) + O(n²)  // O(n²) is fast growing, O(n) is non dominate
= O(n²)

```

3. Different inputs => Different variables (Nested Loops)

```js file=index.js highlights=13 show=false

for ( int i =0;i<a;i++) //O(n)
{
  for ( int j=0;j<b;j++) { } //O(n)
}

Time Complexity
f(n)= O(a * b) // O(length of arrray a  * length of array b)
f(n) = O(n * n )
f(n) = O(n² )
```

#### Time Complexities in Order :

O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) O(n log n) < O(n²) < O(2ⁿ) < O(n!)
